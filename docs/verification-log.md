# Verification Log
Append-only. One dated section per run.

Per-run full detail lives under `docs/verification-log/<file>.md` (one file
per section below, extracted to reduce merge contention on this file — see
DEC-068/DEC-069). Each section here keeps the exact `## <date> <branch> —
<scope> @ <sha>` header and, where applicable, the closing `RESULT:` /
`OPEN ITEMS:` line verbatim, so this file alone remains sufficient for the
DEC-069 exit-predicate grep.

## 2026-08-10 task-w12-a — build+test @ 01c6ace

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w12-a-build-test.md

- install/build/unit tests: ALL PASS (334 packages; 81 files / 859 tests, 0
  failures). No fixes required.

## 2026-08-10 task-w12-c — commit-body triage @ f6e3422

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w12-c-triage.md

Triage table of 6 PLANNER:/defect notes harvested from wave-8/10 merge
commit bodies: 3 fixed-cite/fixed-here (already resolved on main), 3
open-PLANNER (feature gaps at the time; all 3 later resolved — see
task-w13-c below).

## 2026-08-10 task-w12-b — walkthrough @ f6e3422

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w12-b-walkthrough.md

- install/build/migrate/seed/wrangler-dev/walkthrough (producer, review,
  speaker, public, data — J1-J12): ALL PASS. No FAIL lines, no PLANNER:
  lines. (Note: port 8787 collision with a concurrent worktree worked
  around by re-running on port 8797; not a product defect.)

## 2026-08-10 task-w13-a — build+test @ 0ee30dd

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w13-a-build-test.md

- install/build/bundle:check/test: ALL PASS (82 files / 861 tests). No
  product-code changes required.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w13-b — walkthrough @ 0ee30dd

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w13-b-walkthrough.md

- install/migrate/seed/wrangler-dev/walkthrough (producer, review, speaker,
  public, data — J1-J12): ALL PASS. No FAIL lines, no PLANNER: lines.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w13-d — perf-smoke @ 0ee30dd

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w13-d-perf-smoke.md

- perf:seed (2k-row scale) + perf:smoke, p95 < 150ms budget on submissions
  list/search, submission detail, event overview: ALL PASS (7.6-13.2ms
  measured). build + test also PASS in the same worktree.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w13-e — spec-audit @ 0ee30dd

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w13-e-spec-audit.md

- SPEC §8 quickstart/README parity, README evaluator credentials vs
  fixtures, CI typecheck+test coverage, SPEC §9 four named invariants
  (close-date lock, speaker isolation, hidden-speaker exclusion,
  decision-does-not-auto-email): ALL PASS. One new regression test added
  (test/spec9-invariants.test.ts). Full suite 83 files / 862 tests PASS.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w13-c — triage closure @ d4ebf7f

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w13-c-triage-closure.md

Dispositioned the three open-PLANNER: rows from task-w12-c: 2 got real
inline fixes (co-presenter invite endpoint, participant-visibility toggle
endpoint, both with authz + regression tests), 1 got a test-tree-only fix
(cross-org export isolation, fake-db unit test) since touching
scripts/seed.ts is out of scope under the no-eval-gaming rule. No FAIL
bullets anywhere in the log. Full suite 84 files / 869 tests PASS.

OPEN ITEMS: 0

## 2026-08-10 task-w14-g — walkthrough module runs @ 64141d0

scripts/walkthrough/speaker.ts and scripts/walkthrough/public.ts converted
from direct `wrangler d1 execute --local` fixture workarounds to the real
DEC-070 organizer endpoints (POST /api/v1/submissions/:id/participants,
PATCH /api/v1/submissions/:id/participants/:participantId). Added one new
authz probe (speaker session POSTing the invite endpoint -> 403).

- `npm run build` and `npm test` (89 files / 898 tests): ALL PASS.
- Fresh `npm run db:migrate && npm run seed` against a local wrangler dev
  on port 8799 (avoiding the port-8787 collision noted for concurrent
  worktrees in this log), then:
  - `npx tsx scripts/walkthrough/speaker.ts --url http://localhost:8799`:
    ALL PASS (49 checks, including the new 403 authz probe and both
    co-presenter invite calls returning inviteStatus 'invited').
  - `npx tsx scripts/walkthrough/public.ts --url http://localhost:8799`:
    ALL PASS (27 checks, including the hidden-participant visibility gate
    via the PATCH endpoint).

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w15-a — walkthrough endpoint-conversion closeout @ 0ba550c

Re-verified DEC-076's single code barrier: confirmed task-w14-g's endpoint
conversion is already on main. `grep -n "INSERT INTO participant\|UPDATE
participant SET visible\|no admin API" scripts/walkthrough/speaker.ts
scripts/walkthrough/public.ts` returns nothing — no direct-SQL participant
writes, no stale "stage 1 has no admin API" comments remain. Both scripts
already call POST /api/v1/submissions/:id/participants and PATCH
/api/v1/submissions/:id/participants/:participantId per DEC-070/DEC-053.

- `npm run build` and `npm test` (89 files / 898 tests): ALL PASS.
- `npx vitest run test/walkthrough-lib.test.ts`: ALL PASS (10 tests).

No product-code or script changes required; this task is verification-only
per the task's own instruction (task overlapped in-flight task-w14-g, which
had already landed the conversion by the time this task started).

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w15-b — build+test @ 7c4101c

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w15-b-build-test.md

DEC-068/069 gate lane, fresh worktree of main (`7c4101c`, "merge
task-w15-a"). `npm ci`, `npm run build` (tsc x2 + vite), `npm test`
(89 files / 898 tests, includes `test/bundle-check.test.ts` for the
DEC-058 js+css<300KB gz budget): ALL PASS. No trivial breakages hit; no
inline fixes needed. Verification-only — no product code or scripts
changed, so this merge is NOT code-bearing and does not invalidate
sibling gates under DEC-076.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w15-e — spec-audit @ 7c4101c

Re-ran the task-w13-e SPEC §8/§9 checklist at the post-DEC-076-barrier sha
in a fresh worktree of `main` (`7c4101c`). README/package.json quickstart
parity and evaluator credentials still match `docs/fixtures/sample-data.json`
verbatim; CI still covers typecheck+test plus the DEC-063 `walkthrough` job;
all four SPEC §9 invariants (close-date lock, speaker isolation,
hidden-speaker exclusion, decision-never-auto-emails) still have passing
regression tests, unchanged since w13-e. Confirmed all four wave-14 security
fixes carry regression tests on `main`: DEC-074
`test/portal-edit-track-validation.test.ts`, DEC-071
`test/portal-link-absolute.test.ts`, DEC-072
`test/rate-limit-identity-keys.test.ts`, and DEC-073's roomId test —
located at `test/agenda-room-ownership.test.ts` rather than the task's
file hint — covering both the write-path rejection
(`roomBelongsToEvent` in `src/routes/agenda.ts:60`) and the event-scoped
public room lookup (`src/server/repo/public.ts:361`). DEC-070's endpoints
reject cross-org callers — coverage lives in `test/api-participants.test.ts`
(two "cross-org isolation" tests, lines 190/259), not
`test/api-submissions.test.ts` as hinted; `api-submissions.test.ts:268`
only carries an unrelated tripwire count for the DEC-070 module move. No
invariant lacked a test, so no new test was added (verification-only, not
code-bearing). `npm run build` and `npm test` (89 files / 898 tests): ALL
PASS. Full detail: `docs/verification-log/task-w15-e-spec-audit.md`.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w15-c — walkthrough @ 7c4101c

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w15-c-walkthrough.md

Full J1-J12 gate in a clean worktree of main at `7c4101c` (post-barrier
per DEC-076): `npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm test` (89 files / 898 tests)
all PASS. Fresh `npm run db:migrate` + `npm run seed` against local
wrangler dev on port 8811 (8787 was free but 8811 chosen defensively
against concurrent sibling-gate worktrees). Ran
`npx tsx scripts/walkthrough.ts --url http://localhost:8811` (DEC-062
order producer -> review -> speaker -> public -> data): ALL PASS, no FAIL
or PLANNER: lines. Explicitly confirmed the newly-converted DEC-070
participant invite/visibility endpoint calls ran and passed (co-presenter
invite, IDOR rejection, accept/decline, organizer-only authz probe in
speaker.ts; hidden-participant visibility gate in public.ts) — no
direct-SQL fallback remains in either script.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w15-d — perf-smoke @ 7c4101c

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w15-d-perf-smoke.md

Post-barrier (DEC-076) perf smoke, mirroring the CI `perf-smoke` job:
`npm run db:migrate` (9 migrations 0000-0008), `npm run seed`, `npm run
perf:seed` (2k-row scale), `wrangler dev` health-checked, then `npm run
perf:smoke` — p95 24.1-37.2ms, all under the 150ms budget (higher than
w13-d's 7.6-13.2ms but no regression per task guidance: large regressions
are the signal, not tuning). Also ran `npm run build` and `npm test`
(89 files / 898 tests) in the same worktree: ALL PASS.

RESULT: PASS

## 2026-08-10 task-w16-b — walkthrough @ 7ac6aef

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w16-b-walkthrough.md

J1-J12 gate re-run (log-only lane, DEC-077) against main at `7ac6aef`
(later than the `0ba550c` floor; intervening commits are scribe
bookkeeping, non-code-bearing). Fresh `npm ci`, `npm run build`,
`npm run db:migrate` (9 migrations), `npm run seed`, `wrangler dev` on
port 8801 (reserved, not 8787), then `npm run walkthrough -- --url
http://localhost:8801` running producer -> review -> speaker -> public ->
data in order: 5/16/50/29/20 checks respectively, all PASS, zero FAIL or
PLANNER: lines anywhere in the output.

RESULT: PASS
