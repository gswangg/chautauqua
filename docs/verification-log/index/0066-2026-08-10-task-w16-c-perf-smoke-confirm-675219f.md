## 2026-08-10 task-w16-c — perf-smoke confirm @ 675219f

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w16-c-perf-smoke-confirm.md

DEC-128 confirm-else-run: re-derived DEC-114 newest code-bearing sha —
first-parent walk from main tip `067a5cc` ("scribe wave 16"): that
commit and `2280419` (merge task-w15-j) and `21ea856` (scribe wave 15)
are all bookkeeping-only (docs/decisions/field-guide, no `src`/`scripts`
diff); first-parent lands on `675219f` ("merge task-w14-k"), which
touches `src/routes/portal/edit.tsx`, `src/server/repo/portal-edit.ts`,
and test files — code-bearing. Confirms `675219f` as expected.

RESULT: PASS
