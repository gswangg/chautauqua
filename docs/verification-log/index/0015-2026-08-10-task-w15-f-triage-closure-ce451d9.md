## 2026-08-10 task-w15-f — triage-closure @ ce451d9

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w15-f-triage-closure.md

Clean worktree of latest main at `ce451d9` (post walkthrough-gate w15-c,
per DEC-076 chain order). Dispositioned the three w12-c open-PLANNER
rows (all already closed on main per DEC-070/075: co-presenter invite +
visibility PATCH endpoints with route + repo tests, walkthrough scripts
converted off direct-SQL, and a route-level cross-org export test
covering every `EXPORT_KINDS` entry plus showflow.csv), harvested
merge-commit bodies `0ee30dd..HEAD` for `PLANNER:` notes (none found —
re-checked reflog/branch list to confirm no branch silently dropped),
and confirmed `docs/verification-log.md` carries zero unresolved
`RESULT: FAIL` lines. `npm run build` and `npm test` (89 files / 898
tests): ALL PASS.

OPEN ITEMS: 0

RESULT: PASS
