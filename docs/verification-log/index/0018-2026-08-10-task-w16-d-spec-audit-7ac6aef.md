## 2026-08-10 task-w16-d — spec-audit @ 7ac6aef

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w16-d-spec-audit.md

Wave-16 code-frozen (DEC-077) re-run of the SPEC §8/§9 static audit in a
fresh worktree of `main` at `7ac6aef`. Confirmed via `git diff
7c4101c..HEAD --stat` that zero source/test/config files changed since
the w15-e spec-audit ran at `7c4101c` (only scribe bookkeeping: DEC-077,
field-guide, `src/decisions.ts` +1 line, verification-log entries). §8
quickstart commands (`db:migrate`, `seed`, `walkthrough`, `perf:*`,
`test`) match README verbatim; README evaluator credentials diffed
exactly against `docs/fixtures/sample-data.json`; CI covers typecheck +
test + bundle:check + the DEC-063 `walkthrough` job; all four SPEC §9
invariants (close-date lock, speaker isolation, hidden-speaker exclusion,
decision-never-auto-emails) re-confirmed against
`test/edit-lock.test.ts` + `test/submit-core.test.ts`,
`test/task-file-access.test.ts:117`, `test/headshot-gate.test.ts:80`, and
`test/spec9-invariants.test.ts:58` respectively — all pre-existing, no
gap, no test added (log-only lane per DEC-077). DEC-005 route map
spot-checked against `src/index.ts` mounts and leaf routes in
`src/routes/public.tsx` / `src/routes/files.ts` — matches. `npm run
build` and `npm test` both PASS (89 files / 898 tests, identical to
w15-e).

RESULT: PASS
