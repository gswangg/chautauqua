## 2026-08-10 task-w11-c — walkthrough @ 3b7ed3d

Full detail: docs/verification-log/task-w11-c-walkthrough.md

DEC-069 J1-J12 walkthrough gate, log-only lane (DEC-077: no product/
test/script/config changes made in this task). Fresh worktree of `main`
at the task-w11-a merge commit `3b7ed3d` ("merge task-w11-a") — this is
the newest commit on `main` at branch time and is code-bearing per
DEC-091/114 (it lands `scripts/walkthrough/speaker.ts`'s DEC-112/113
closeout probes, commits `e98e4c9` "Walkthrough: add DEC-112 runtime
probes for DEC-108 invite-visibility and DEC-111 form-task self-heal"
and `2d686bd` "walkthrough/speaker.ts: land DEC-112 closeout probes per
DEC-113"). Confirmed present in-tree before running anything: `grep -n
"chq-session-card\|speakers-block\|Flight\|Hotel"
scripts/walkthrough/speaker.ts` shows the Hotel/Flight backing-form
task assertions (lines ~357-368, ~541-566) and the invite A/B/C
fixture flow feeding the public chq-session-card/speakers-block scoped
assertions (exercised in `scripts/walkthrough/public.ts`) — the
DEC-112/113 probes are on `main`, not absent.

RESULT: PASS
