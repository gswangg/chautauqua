## Standing rules (still bind)

- **Targeted tests only, in-wave**; full suite only at merge-train
  batches/exit waves via `scripts/with-test-lock.sh`.
- **Items close on measured or runtime evidence, never a code read alone.**
- **docs/ precedence:** `docs/clarifications.md` overrides all;
  `decisions/DEC-*.md` binding, compile-checked via `src/decisions.ts`
  (never hand-edit); rest of `docs/` informs, doesn't override.
- **No eval gaming.** Rubric/fixtures inform what to build; product code
  never references fixture values or rubric IDs.
- **A mandate item moves tier only on a citation re-run at the moving
  wave's own runtime** — never inheriting a prior verdict or a brief's
  restated claim (DEC-069, DEC-976 wave-25 amendment).
- **IN FLIGHT is built from `.git` ref state at the writing task's own
  runtime** (DEC-069 wave-17 amendment). A branch whose tip equals its
  merge-base with `main` produced zero commits — UNLESS it was created
  within this same wave and may still be running (DEC-069 wave-37
  amendment): check `.git/logs/refs/heads/<branch>`'s creation timestamp
  against sibling lanes before calling it dead.
- **A recorded ruling is not a landed fix** (DEC-358 wave-31 amendment): a
  DEC amendment's argued file:line is a mandate, not a receipt — only a
  diff or an exercised check closes an item.
- **A branch-local PASS is not a closure** (DEC-644 wave-35 amendment): a
  perf/sweep row moves out of FAIL only on a reading taken at a boundary
  that contains EVERY fix credited with closing it; two lanes each
  measuring their own fix with the sibling fix absent produce two PASS
  readings and zero readings of the tree that actually shipped.
- **A closed TIER 0 row names its falsifying check** (DEC-358 wave-37
  amendment): a code-shape citation alone is not a closure backing; label
  it `UNFALSIFIABLE — owner: wave-38 lane` and keep it, don't delete it.
- **An absence is a measurement, not a note to carry** (DEC-358 wave-35
  amendment): a rebase re-globs every "file X does not exist" claim before
  carrying it; an existence claim that survives a rebase unre-globbed is
  DELETED rather than carried forward. Same applies to ref-existence
  claims — a `.git/packed-refs` stale entry is a live trap, not a citation.
- **The vendored frame pack is `docs/design/*.dc.html`**; where a research
  render measurement conflicts with vendored `docs/design/README.md`, the
  README wins.
